# Gabie here! 👋

<!-- ### **About Me** <br/> -->

I'm currently pursuing cybersecurity in New York with the hopes of making it in the industry as a long coming dream of mine.  

But aside from working things out to get there, **I have multiple (maybe too many) hobbies and interests that keep me sane:**   

&emsp; ☕ Being a (try hard) Coffee enthusiast/barista  
&emsp; 📸 Photography and editing  
&emsp; 📚 Book and Manga reader  
&emsp; 🎮 Video games  
&emsp; 🗺 Traveling  
&emsp; 🏁 Car racing (mostly a Formula 1) fan  
&emsp; 🏐 Follower of international indoor volleyball  

That's a simple way of explaining who I am, but I'll let my GitHub tell you the rest of my technical side.  

**Ciao! 👋**
